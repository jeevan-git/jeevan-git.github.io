ABU ROBOCON 2018 theme based international robotics competitions where students from the 20 different countries participate with the robots the build. The theme of ROBOCON 2018 was to make two robots one manual and one automatics, and the task was to throw the shuttlecock through rings at a certain height. Our team representing NEPAL was able to win the "BEST SHUTTLECOCK AWARD" for the shuttlecock rack transfer mechanism.
